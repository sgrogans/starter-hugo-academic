Shannon Grogans is a clinical psychology doctoral student working with Dr. Alexander Shackman at the Affective Translational Neuroscience Laboratory at University of Maryland, College Park. She graduated cum laude from Northwestern University
in 2016 with an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science (cognitive neuroscience concentration) and Psychology, and formerly conducted research under the direction of Robin Nusslock. After graduation, she completed a Post-Baccalaureate  Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) Fellowship with Karen Berman in the Section on Integrative Neuroimaging at the NIMH. Her current research interests include understanding how individual differences in temperament, emotion regulation abilities, and stress exposure impact risk and resilience for mood and anxiety symptomatology.
